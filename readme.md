# Machine Learning Library

We use the tensorflow library, so we also need to be on python 3.11. This is a library full of simple machine learning projects. The purpose of this is just to discover the basics of machine learning.

## Creating the venv

`python3.11 -m venv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

## Installing Dependencies

`pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow pillow h5py keras`

or

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Saving venv

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

`deactivate`
